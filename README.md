Blow the frontend project, was used Angular 7, RJxS, Material IO, TypeScript.

In the backend, Spring Boot, String Data, Spring Rest, JPA and H2 were used for in-memory databases.

The approach was to login to the api, then enter the data into the application database, making it independent of the external api.

A cron has been created to update the local database from time to time.
